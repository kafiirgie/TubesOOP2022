# IF2212 Project Template

Here is an example of project using gradle as the build tools.
Try running these commands:

On linux:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

On windows:
```cmd
gradlew.bat run
```

Notice that it will run the `Main.java` inside the `com.monstersaku` package.
In the command line you can see the data that is being read by `CSVReader.java`.

What happen is when you use `./gradlew run`, it will start the main function in your app.
For this app, the main function lives in `Main.java`.
